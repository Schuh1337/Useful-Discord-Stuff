Okay, imagine you have a toy that you really like to play with, and you want to make sure it’s still working. So, you keep asking your toy, “Are you okay?” over and over again. But your toy is really good at answering, and it doesn’t get tired or upset by you asking it all the time.

When we use something called “ping” on a computer to ask an IP address (which is like the toy's name) if it’s okay, it’s just like asking, “Are you okay?” The IP address is like a super-fast and very patient toy that can handle lots of “Are you okay?” questions without getting tired or slow. So, asking a lot of times doesn’t make it slow or upset. It just keeps answering back quickly!
