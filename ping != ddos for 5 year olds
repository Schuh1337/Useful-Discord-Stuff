Imagine you have a toy and you press a button on it once or twice—it doesn't cause any problems, right? Now, think of your computer like that toy. When you use the ping command in Windows CMD to check if another computer or server is there, it's like asking, "Are you awake?" and waiting for a "Yes" or "No." It's very light and harmless, just like pressing the button on the toy.

Even if you keep asking the same question over and over again by spamming the ping command, it still won’t cause any real problems. It’s just one person asking a small question. Computers and servers are designed to handle a lot more than that without any issues.

A real DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, on the other hand, is like a huge group of people pressing that toy's button all at once, thousands or millions of times, which can overwhelm the toy and make it stop working. But just sending a few pings or even spamming the command a bit won't do anything close to that because it's like a single small voice, not a huge crowd.

In short, using the ping command is like gently asking a computer if it's there, and even spamming it won’t hurt anything—certainly not like a DDoS!
