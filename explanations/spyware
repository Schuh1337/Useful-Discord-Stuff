Imagine you have a special diary where you write down all your secrets and thoughts. Now, think about a sneaky person who hides in your room and reads your diary without you knowing.

Spyware is like that sneaky person. When you use your computer, it hides in the background and watches everything you do. It remembers the websites you visit, the things you type, and even your passwords! Then, it sends all that information to someone else, like a stranger, who shouldn’t have it.

So, just like you wouldn’t want anyone snooping through your diary, you don’t want spyware looking at your computer secrets!
