Imagine you have a secret door in your house that only your family knows about. One day, a sneaky person finds that door and slips inside without anyone noticing. They start doing things inside your house while staying hidden from everyone.

Rootkits are like that sneaky person. They are special programs that hide deep inside your computer and help other bad software stay hidden too. When a rootkit is on your computer, it can let hackers control your system without you knowing.

So, just like you’d want to keep all your secret doors safe, it’s important to protect your computer from rootkits that try to sneak in and take control!
