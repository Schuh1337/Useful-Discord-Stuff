Phishing is like a trick or a scam where someone pretends to be a trustworthy person or company to steal your important information, like passwords or credit card numbers.

Imagine you get a letter in the mail that looks like it’s from your favorite toy store. The letter says you’ve won a special prize, but you need to give them your home address and some personal information to claim it. If you’re not careful, you might think it’s real and share your details, but it’s actually a trick!

In the digital world, phishing usually happens through emails, messages, or fake websites that look very similar to the real ones. For example, you might receive an email that looks like it’s from your bank, asking you to click a link and enter your login information. If you do, you might be giving your information to a sneaky scammer instead of your actual bank.

To protect yourself from phishing, it’s important to always check who the message is really from, avoid clicking on strange links, and never share personal information unless you are sure it’s safe. Just like you wouldn’t give your address to someone you don’t know, you shouldn’t share your information online without being careful!
