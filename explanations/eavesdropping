Imagine you’re at a party, and two friends are having a secret chat in the corner. But there’s someone hiding nearby, listening to everything they say without them knowing!

Eavesdropping is like that sneaky listener. It’s when someone tries to overhear your conversations or gather information without your permission, especially online.

So, just like you’d want to keep your secrets safe at a party, be cautious about what you share in chats and online messages!
