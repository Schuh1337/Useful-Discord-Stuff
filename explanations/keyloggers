A keylogger is like a sneaky spy that hides in your computer and watches everything you type on your keyboard, like a detective secretly taking notes.

Imagine you’re writing a secret message or typing in a password to a treasure chest, and someone is sitting quietly next to you, copying down every word or number you type without you noticing. That’s what a keylogger does—it records every key you press on the keyboard.

Once it has collected your information, like passwords, messages, or anything else you type, the keylogger sends it to the person who put it there. This can be very bad because it can steal private information, like your passwords or credit card numbers, without you even knowing!

To stay safe from keyloggers, you should be careful about downloading files or clicking on strange links, just like you wouldn’t want a spy sneaking into your room to watch you!
