magine you have a treasure box filled with your favorite toys. One day, a sneaky villain comes along and locks your treasure box with a special key. They tell you that you canâ€™t open it unless you give them some of your candy or toys.

Ransomware is like that villain! It's a bad program that locks up your computer files, like pictures or games, and won't let you use them until you pay money. The people who make ransomware are trying to trick you into giving them something valuable, just like the villain wanted your candy. The best way to stay safe is to be careful about what you click on and always ask an adult if something looks suspicious!
