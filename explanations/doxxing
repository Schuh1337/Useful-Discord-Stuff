Imagine you have a secret diary where you write down your thoughts, dreams, and personal stuff. Now, let’s say someone finds your diary and decides to share everything in it with the whole school, including your favorite secrets, where you live, and who your friends are. That would feel really uncomfortable and unsafe, right?

Doxxing is kind of like that. It’s when someone gathers private information about a person—like their real name, address, phone number, or other personal details—and shares it publicly without that person’s permission. This can happen online when people reveal someone’s information in a mean or harmful way.

So, just like you’d want to keep your diary private, it’s important to be careful about sharing your personal information online to protect yourself from doxxing!
