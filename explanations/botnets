Picture a group of toy robots that are all controlled by one mean kid. Whenever he presses a button, all the robots start doing what he wants, like making a mess or bothering everyone in the toy room!

Botnets are like those toy robots. They are collections of infected computers that hackers control. The hackers can send commands to all the infected computers at once, making them do things like sending spam emails or attacking other computers.

So, just like you wouldn’t want your toys to be controlled by someone else, it’s important to keep your computer safe from becoming part of a botnet!
