Imagine you ask your friend for directions to the park, but they give you the wrong way on purpose, leading you to a place you didn’t want to go!

DNS Spoofing is like that trickster friend. It involves changing the way your computer translates website names into IP addresses, leading you to fake sites instead of the real ones. This can let hackers steal your information.

So, just like you’d want accurate directions to the park, make sure your internet connections are secure to avoid DNS spoofing!
