Imagine you have a secret clubhouse with a special password to get in. But one day, a sneaky kid finds out your password and tries to use it to get into other kids’ clubhouses too.

Credential Stuffing is like that sneaky kid. It’s when hackers take usernames and passwords from one place, like a stolen database, and try to use them on different websites to break in. Many people use the same password for different things, making it easier for the hackers.

So, just like you’d want to use different passwords for your secret clubhouses, it’s important to have unique passwords for your online accounts to keep them safe!
