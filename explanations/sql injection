Think of a toy box that has a secret code to open it. But someone figures out how to trick the lock and opens it without using the right code!

SQL Injection is like that clever trick. It’s a way for hackers to send malicious commands to a website’s database, allowing them to steal or change information without permission. This happens when websites don’t have strong protections.

So, just like you’d want to keep your toy box locked tight, websites need to have good security to protect against SQL injection!
