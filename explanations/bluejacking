Imagine you’re in school, and a friend sends you a funny message through a special walkie-talkie. But then, someone you don’t know sends a weird message too, and you have no idea who they are!

Bluejacking is like that unexpected message. It’s when someone uses Bluetooth technology to send messages to nearby devices without permission. While it’s usually harmless, it can be annoying or even used to send spam.

So, just like you’d want to know who you’re talking to, be careful with Bluetooth connections to avoid bluejacking surprises!
