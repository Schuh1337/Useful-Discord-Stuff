Think of someone who pretends to be a friendly delivery person and knocks on your door. They say, “I have a special package for you! Can you tell me your name and where you keep your toys?”

Social Engineering is like that tricky delivery person. It’s when someone tries to fool you into giving them your personal information by pretending to be someone trustworthy. They might use phone calls, emails, or even face-to-face tricks to get you to share secrets.

So, just like you’d be careful about who you talk to at your door, be cautious when someone asks for your information online, because social engineering can be very sneaky!
