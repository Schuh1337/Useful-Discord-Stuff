Think of your favorite website having a copycat that looks just like it, but when you click on it, it leads you somewhere else completely!

Domain Spoofing is like that copycat website. It tricks you into thinking it’s the real site by using a similar web address. This can lead you to give away personal information or download bad software.

So, just like you’d want to make sure you’re going to the right place, always check the web addresses carefully to avoid domain spoofing!
