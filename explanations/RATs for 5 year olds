Imagine your computer is like a big, safe house where you keep all your favorite toys and secrets. You get to decide who comes inside to play or who you share your toys with.

Now, let’s say a sneaky person leaves a tiny robot mouse at your doorstep that looks harmless. You might let it in without thinking, but what you don’t know is that this robot mouse has a secret! It’s sending messages back to the sneaky person, telling them everything about your house—like where you keep your toys or what you're doing. Sometimes, it might even let the sneaky person control things inside your house without you knowing!

That’s what a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is like. It’s a sneaky program that tricks people into letting it inside their computer (house). Once inside, it lets someone else secretly see what’s going on or even control the computer without the person knowing, which can be really bad. Just like you wouldn’t let a suspicious robot mouse into your house, you have to be careful not to let sneaky programs like RATs into your computer by clicking on strange links or downloading things from unknown places!
