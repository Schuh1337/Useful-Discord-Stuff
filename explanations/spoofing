Imagine you receive a letter that looks like it’s from your best friend, but when you open it, it’s really from someone else trying to trick you. They’re pretending to be your friend to get you to share your secrets.

Spoofing is like that. It’s when someone pretends to be someone else online—like using a fake email address or phone number—to trick you into revealing personal information or doing something you wouldn’t normally do.

Sometimes, spoofing can make it look like a message is coming from someone you trust, like a family member or a well-known company, so you’re more likely to believe it’s real. This makes it even trickier to spot!
