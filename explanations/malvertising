Picture going to a carnival, and you see a fun-looking game booth. But when you try to play, it releases a bunch of water balloons that soak you instead!

Malvertising is like that sneaky booth. It’s when advertisements on websites contain harmful software. You might click on an ad thinking it’s safe, but it can lead to malware downloading onto your computer.

So, just like you’d be careful about where you play at a carnival, be cautious with ads on the internet, because some can be hiding bad surprises!
