Think about a candy shop with a sign that looks just like your favorite place. You think it’s the right shop, but when you go inside, they’re selling vegetables instead!

URL Spoofing is like that tricky sign. It’s when a fake website pretends to be a real one by using a similar-looking web address. If you click on it, you might be tricked into giving away information or downloading malware.

So, just like you’d want to make sure you’re going to the right shop, check web addresses carefully to avoid URL spoofing!
