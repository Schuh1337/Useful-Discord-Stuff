Imagine you have a computer, like a video game controller, that you use to control what happens on the screen. You can see everything you’re doing, like moving characters or clicking buttons.

Now, let’s say there’s another kind of controller called HVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing), but it’s sneaky. When someone uses HVNC, they can control your computer without you seeing it on your screen! It’s like someone has an invisible game controller and is playing on your computer without you even knowing they’re there.

They can open programs, type things, and look at your private information, all while your computer looks normal to you. It's hidden, which is why it's called "hidden" VNC.

To keep your computer safe from things like HVNC, you need to be careful about what programs you download or websites you visit, just like making sure no one sneaks in and uses your stuff without permission!
