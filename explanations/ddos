Imagine a playground filled with kids having fun. Suddenly, a big group of kids rushes in and pushes everyone aside, making it impossible for anyone to play!

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are like that group of kids. They flood a website or online service with too much traffic, making it slow or crash. This can prevent people from using the website at all.

So, just like you’d want to keep the playground safe for everyone, it’s important to protect websites from DDoS attacks that can disrupt everyone’s fun!
