Sometimes, you might get a call from someone who says they are from a well-known tech company. They inform you that there’s a problem with your computer and ask for access to resolve it.

While browsing online, you might find a rare toy listed for an unbelievably low price. After you pay, the seller disappears, and you never receive your item. This is an Online Auction Scam, where scammers list fake items for sale to trick people into sending them money.
