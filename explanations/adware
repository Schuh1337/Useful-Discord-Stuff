Now, imagine you’re playing with your toys, but every few minutes, a friend keeps interrupting you to show you new toy ads and commercials. Even when you’re not interested, they keep saying, “Look at this cool toy!”

Adware works kind of like that friend. It shows you ads while you’re using your computer, even if you didn’t ask to see them. Adware watches what you like to look at online and tries to show you ads for those things.

While it might seem like it’s trying to help, it can get really annoying and clutter up your screen. Just like you’d want to tell that friend to stop interrupting, you’d want to get rid of adware to have a cleaner and more fun computer experience!
