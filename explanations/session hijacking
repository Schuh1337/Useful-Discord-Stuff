Imagine you’re playing with your friends on a video chat. Suddenly, someone sneaky sneaks in and pretends to be you, tricking your friends into giving them your secrets!

Session Hijacking is like that sneaky impersonator. It happens when someone takes over a connection you have with a website, like a chat or an online game. They can pretend to be you and steal your information.

So, just like you’d want to keep your conversations private and secure, make sure your online sessions are safe from hijackers who want to sneak in!
