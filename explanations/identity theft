Imagine someone steals your backpack, finds your name tag, and starts pretending to be you at school. They tell your friends lies and get away with things you wouldn’t do!

Identity Theft is like that backpack thief. It’s when someone steals your personal information, like your name or social security number, to pretend to be you. They might use this information to commit fraud or other bad things.

So, just like you’d want to keep your backpack safe from thieves, protect your personal information to avoid identity theft!
