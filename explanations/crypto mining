Imagine you’re digging in a sandbox looking for hidden treasure, and each time you find a shiny coin, you get to keep it! The more you dig, the more coins you find.

Crypto Mining is like that digging for treasure, but on a computer. People use powerful computers to solve complex math problems, and when they solve one, they earn digital coins, like Bitcoin.

Sometimes, hackers might use your computer to mine these coins without you knowing, which can slow down your computer and use up a lot of energy. It’s like if someone else snuck into your sandbox and started digging for treasure without asking!

So, just like you’d want to protect your sandbox from sneaky diggers, make sure your computer is safe from unwanted crypto mining that can use up its resources!
