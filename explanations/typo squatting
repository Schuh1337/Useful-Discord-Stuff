Think of someone setting up a store with a sign that’s almost the same as your favorite candy shop, but they spell it wrong. When you accidentally go in, you find out they don’t sell candy at all!

Typo-squatting is like that misspelled store. It’s when a website is created with a name similar to a popular site but with a small mistake in the spelling. People might accidentally visit this site and get tricked into giving away their information.

So, just like you’d want to make sure you’re entering the right shop, be careful with website addresses to avoid typo-squatting!
