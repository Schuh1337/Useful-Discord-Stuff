Think of a little worm that sneaks into your garden and starts munching on all your flowers. It keeps multiplying and spreading until it’s everywhere!

Worms work like that. They are programs that spread from computer to computer, making copies of themselves and causing damage along the way. They can slow down your system and cause a mess without needing your help to spread.

Just like you wouldn’t want worms ruining your garden, you should keep your computer safe from worms that can spread and create problems!
