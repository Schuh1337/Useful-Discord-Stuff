Imagine you have a special box where you keep all your toys, secrets, and drawings. Now, let’s say you let someone borrow that box. But instead of just taking one toy or secret, they take everything out of the box and make a big list of everything inside it!

Loggers work kind of like that. When you run a program (like an exe), it’s like opening your toy box. A logger is a sneaky little tool that looks at everything inside—like your personal information, passwords, and even what you’ve been doing on your computer. Then, it sends all that information to someone else without you knowing, just like if the borrower made a list of all your toys and secrets and sent it to their friend!

So, just remember: always be careful about what programs you run, because some of them might have loggers that take all your important stuff without asking!
