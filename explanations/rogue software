Imagine someone comes to your house and says, “I’m a special helper! I can clean your toys for you, but you have to pay me first!” You pay them, but they don’t really help at all!

Rogue Software is like that untrustworthy helper. It pretends to be useful software, like antivirus or cleaning programs, but it doesn’t really do anything good. Instead, it may try to trick you into paying for services you don’t need.

So, just like you’d want to make sure helpers are really there to assist you, be careful with software that claims to be helpful but is actually a scam!
