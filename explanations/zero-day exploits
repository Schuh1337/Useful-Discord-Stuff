Picture a brand-new toy that just came out. Everyone wants it, but before anyone knows how it works, a sneaky kid figures out how to break it and ruin the fun!

Zero-Day Exploits are like that sneaky kid. They take advantage of a newly discovered weakness in software that hasn’t been fixed yet. Hackers can use this vulnerability to attack before anyone knows about it.

So, just like you’d want to keep your new toys safe from sneaky kids, software needs to be updated to protect against zero-day exploits!
