Imagine you have a favorite book you always read. But one day, someone comes and swaps it out for a book you don’t like, making it hard for you to find your favorite!

Browser Hijacking is like that book swapper. It changes your web browser settings without your permission, like your homepage or search engine. This can make it harder for you to find what you want and might show you unwanted ads.

So, just like you’d want to keep your favorite book, protect your browser settings to avoid hijacking!
