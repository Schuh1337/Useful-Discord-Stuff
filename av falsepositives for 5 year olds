Okay, imagine you have a big box of crayons and you're coloring a picture. Sometimes, you might use lots of colors and make your picture look really fancy with lots of squiggles and patterns. Now, let’s say you have a special friend who is really good at finding mistakes in your picture.

But, because you made your picture so fancy and confusing with all the squiggles and patterns, your friend might accidentally think you made a mistake when you didn’t. They might say, "Oops, there's a mistake here!" even though there’s nothing wrong.

In the same way, on a computer, there’s something called antivirus software that looks out for bad stuff (like germs) that might try to mess up your computer. Sometimes, the software gets confused if a program is really fancy and tricky, and it might think there’s something bad when there isn’t. That’s what we call a "false positive."

So, just like how your friend might think there’s a mistake in your colorful picture when there isn’t one, the antivirus software might think there’s something wrong when everything is actually okay.
